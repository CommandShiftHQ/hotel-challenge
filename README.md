# Hotel Challenge

Your challenge is to create a database and web API for a hotel booking system, which implements the following requirements:

## Requirements

- Users should be able to sign up to the system with a name and email address

- Hotels should be able to register with a name, address and email address

- Users should be able to make bookings at hotels

- Bookings have a start data and an end date

- Bookings must be accepted by the hotel

- To prevent overbooking, hotels should specify the number of rooms that they have

- If a booking is requested and all the rooms in a hotel are booked on any of requested the nights, do not allow the booking to be made

- Hotels can set exceptions for days where they have more or less rooms available than usual

- The above should only account for confirmed bookings
